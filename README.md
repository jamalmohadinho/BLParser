# 📘 BLParser

**BLParser** is a Java-based parser for a custom language called **BL (Block Language)**. It reads `.bl` source files, tokenizes them, parses their structure, and prints a formatted version of the program. The parser supports both primitive and user-defined instructions, as well as control flow like `IF`, `ELSE`, and `WHILE`.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Parses and validates BL language programs
- 🔄 Handles nested `IF/ELSE` and `WHILE` structures
- 🧠 Recognizes primitive and user-defined instructions
- 🔍 Provides helpful runtime error messages for debugging
- 📂 Includes `.bl` test files and full JUnit test coverage

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Java** (Object-Oriented Design)
- **Custom Data Structures** (`Queue`, `Map`, `Statement`)
- **JUnit** for testing
- **Command-line interface (CLI)**
